notes

commands to add:
simple - tee, dirname, realpath, swap (do we want this? easily solves first level)
medium - ln, mklink, readlink (but everything will break)
hard - tar, which (includes environment variables)

concepts to add: > < PATH (maybe no need for PATH)

alias? might be nice

reboot <-> retry level
?? <-> restart game

man

level ideas:

-- swap two files
-- create something that does >
	-- (cat, |, tee)
-- copy a file
	-- (cat, >)
-- copy a directory without cp
	-- (xargs, find, cat, >)
	-- (tar, cat, >)
-- copy each file into its own directory with the same name
-- flatten a directory
-- flatten a directory with non-unique names (renaming is ok)
-- make 20 files (in only a few commands)
-- make a link to a directory in itself
-- create commands from others (for example the > from before)

sacrifice options:
-- pick one out of everything (seems hard to balance)
-- pick one out of a few options (seems ok)
-- pick one out of those you used (seems like the first one if you're a smartass)

funny stuff we might use:
-- ls a->b b->a: too many levels
-- touch a name that is a link to a non existant file makes it (touch+rm is weird)
-- cd into a link then cd .. is BROKEN, we don't implement this way
